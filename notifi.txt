[2021, CLICK HTML's future plans]
Hi!
Itz 2021 and we want to inform you of new plans for CLICK HTML.

◆ Delete the hosting function that was under development
→ As problems such as server maintenance cost are discovered one after another, the hosting function under development of CLICK HTML will be deleted.

◆ Support for different email addresses
→ We are still thinking about this opinion, but the reason CLICK HTML only supports gmail.com emails was to prevent fraudulent use as a sub-account. This will be discussed and announced in depth with the admins.

◆ Add new blocks
→ (Now you should send your comments to help@blackcats4567.com)
Now, the <center> block has been added, and if you send the blocks you want, we will add it.

◆ Sharing additional blocks
→ We will share additional blocks and create functions that can be used in various projects!
